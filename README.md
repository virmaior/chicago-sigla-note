# chicago-sigla-note
This is a custom CSL for Chicago Note Style with Sigla

I wanted to add this to  https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles

# Usage

I use Zotero and use the custom field sigla. Anything with the custom field "sigla" will after the first mention, get cited with the sigla and page only (no author or date).

# Why not just submit?

This does not validate which violates the policy at https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles

See for instance https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles/issues/7294
